# Implementing computer vision to track quorum sensing in bacterial cultures.
Bacteria use quorum sensing to gather information about the density of other cells in their surroundings. Specifically, *Vibrio fishcheri* can be used as a model to study the activation of bioluminescence by quorum sensing. This work is an extension of the paper titled, "Characterizing Quorum Sensing-Induced Bioluminescence in Variable Volumes With *Vibrio fischeri* Using Computer Processing Methods" (https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/characterizing-quorum-sensing-induced-bioluminescence-in-variable-bolumes-with-em-vibrio-fischeri-em-using-computer-processing-methods). Through image processing, the changes in luminscence of bacterial cultures over time were tracked to study specific mechanisms of quorum sensing.

Bacterial cultures appear in test tubes (example shown below), and thousands of images are taken to collect illumination data on bacterial cultures. Individually cropping each test tube to record illumination instensities over time is a tedious and impractical process. We seek to implement computer vision methods to automatically and efficiently detect test tubes and record illumination data to allow for the collection of high-frequency data over extended periods of time, which will ultimately improve the resolution of bioluminescence time trends.
